# Quicknote v2 — implementation progress

Branch: `dev/v2`
Baseline main SHA: `d3e5a119cdf12ec99fcc14a62545f60729adea54`
Task: QN-001 — BASELINE SCAFFOLD COMMITTED; VERIFICATION PENDING
Updated: 2026-10-11

## Completed repository changes

- Added isolated SQLite temporary HOME fixtures and FTS/save/trash smoke tests.
- Added Unicode roundtrip smoke test.
- Recorded known-failing search identity and duplicate-trash regressions as explicitly skipped assertions.
- Added Go CI workflow for test/vet/build/race.
- Added baseline report and multi-session handoff guidance.

## Verification status

- GitHub commits: yes, on `dev/v2`.
- Local `go test ./...`: not run (unable to clone repository in execution container).
- CI checks: not confirmed. Never interpret a skipped regression as resolved.
- Production data accessed: no.

## Next session

1. Read `docs/QN-001-BASELINE.md` and inspect CI job output on `dev/v2`.
2. Fix compilation or fixture issues if CI reports any; do not silently change assertions to make them pass.
3. Mark QN-001 VERIFIED only after `go test ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go build ./...` pass.
4. Begin QN-002; unskip search identity test after implementing the fix.
5. Keep work off `main` and record actual SHA and test evidence here.

The full 48-task specification was delivered separately as the Quicknote v2 implementation pack; copy that pack into this repository before implementing downstream architecture milestones.
